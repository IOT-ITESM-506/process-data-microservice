# AWS SNS -> SQS -> Lambda -> PostgreSQL Microservice

This repository contains a microservice that utilizes various AWS services to process data from AWS SNS and store it in a PostgreSQL database on AWS RDS.

## Architecture

The architecture of the microservice is composed of the following elements:

1. **AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service):**
   - Used to send messages to subscribers about specific events.

2. **AWS SQS (Simple Queue Service):**
   - Acts as an intermediary to store messages from AWS SNS before being processed by the Lambda.

3. **AWS Lambda:**
   - The Lambda is configured to listen on the SQS queue and automatically process messages when they arrive.
   - The Lambda code extracts data from the message and stores it in the PostgreSQL database.

4. **AWS RDS (Relational Database Service):**
   - Used to host the PostgreSQL database that stores the data processed by the Lambda.

## Configuration

To run this microservice in your environment, follow these steps:

1. **AWS Configuration:**
